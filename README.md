The above two files are for PubMed Summairization. One file is a .ipynb that is a python notebook and the other is a HTML based front end web page.
The Web Page consists of a two buttons, one button deals with uploading the data set and the other button is for summairization
I failed to implement flask and streamlit that can help me to link these buttons with python functions
In a separate python notebook, we have code for loading and downloading the data set and then cleaning the data set to prepare it for summairization
Data has been cleaned through three functions 1) Data Cleaning 2) Tokenization and 3)PreProcessing
We can run these three fucntions to clean the data
